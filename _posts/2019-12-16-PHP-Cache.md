### OpCache
OpCode Caches are a performance enhancing extension for PHP. They do this by injecting themselves into the execution life-cycle of PHP and caching the results of the compilation phase for later reuse. It is not uncommon to see a 3x performance increase just by enabling an OpCode cache.

### APCu
APCu is the old APC without the opcode cache. It is a user cache, which means it must be explicitly used by your PHP code.
