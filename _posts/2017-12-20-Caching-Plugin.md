If the follow plugin was already installed "wordfence", we should look for a caching plugin which would be compatible with it.

The following page mentions Vendi Cache as an alternative to Falcon Cache which was a part of wordfence as it's caching engine.

[The reason why Falcon Cache had been removed from Wordfence was mentioned in this post](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/10/removing-falcon-cache-wordfence-heres-need-know){:target='_blank'}
