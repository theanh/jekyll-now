Hi, my name is Nguyen The Anh.
I was born in 1988.

### Bio

I'm a senior developer. I have been working on the industry since 2011.

I have been working in PHP and Javascript, both of them being my specialty.

I also have experiences on working in
* RoR (3 projects. :grin: it was 2 years ago)
* Java (1 project, but :scream: it was long time ago, so please don't count!).

I'm interesting in the us of technology, impacts of it on agriculture, transportation, and so forth.
